# Home Assistant Configuration

This is my personal configuration for a server running on my Mac Mini. I am fairly new to "smart home" accessories and "home automation" so expect this to grow as I acquire more gadgets for a home I am renting in, lol.

There are various configurations available to look at based on different living situations, feel free to browse the different branches for snapshots of previous configurations.
