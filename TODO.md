# TODO List for this config

## Software

- [x] Automate devices based on temperature (make sure heater doesn't turn on when too warm etc)
- [ ] HASS-based alarm, rework morning briefing
- [ ] Sleep scene, should trigger ambient noise to sleep to
- [ ] VR Active scene... for reasons

## Hardware

- [ ] Get Xiaomi devices (Temp/Humidity sensors, Wireless Buttons at least) for context-sensitive automations
- [ ] Remote control power strips? (Broadlink MP1 strip for example) for more control
- [ ] LED strip beside my bed as a night light?
